<p>The secret services were not unique to the Ming Dynasty, the Han Dynasty had "Zhao Prison" and "Great Who He", Tang had "Lijingmen" and "Bad People", and Song had "Imperial Prison" and "Internal Military Patrol Yuan". The reason why there were secret services throughout the ages was because under the old system, the emperor only represented the interests of his family and a special group in the outer ring, compared to the ruled people, and his position was not only isolated, but always on the verge of danger.
